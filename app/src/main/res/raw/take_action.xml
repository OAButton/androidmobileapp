</question>
<answer>
    <ul>
        <li>
            If you're a student, reach out to your professors and librarians. Reach out to them and let them know you care about open access. Send an email, grab them after class, or set up a meeting. Talk to them, ask can they publish their work Open Access or self archive existing work. Encourage your librarians to include Open Access in the mandatory library orientation for incoming students.  Use this App to bust those myths and answer those questions.
        </li>
        <li>
            Read the sections of our app to get up to speed on everything from the challenges we face in getting access to the results of research, to the impact of limited access and what you need to know about Open Access and Open Access advocacy so we can make progress on this issue together.

    If you have an hour...
</question>
<answer>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Write a blog/op-ed for a local newspaper. Taking your voice to a public forum can be an extremely effective form of advocacy and you all can publish anything you want with just a few clicks on a blog. If you don't have a blog, school/local newspapers are around for just this purposeâ€”and they're often itching for content. Open access affects everybody, and an opinion piece or letter to the editor calling for change - in a few hundred words - is sure to garner interested comments or emails. If you're writing to a newspaper, let us know and we can help.
        </li>
        <li>
            Get your organisations on board. Whether you bring up the access barriers at your institution, or the heavy toll lack of access to research has on students, researchers, patients, and doctors all over the world, or something else. Lots and lots of organizations have an interest in opening up access to academic research. Let them know that access is an issue and urge them to join advocacy efforts.

        <li>
            Get Your Faculty, Colleagues, and Administrators on board
        </li>
        <li>
