    <p>Diego Gomez, a Colombian graduate student, currently faces up to eight years in prison for doing something thousands of researchers do every day: posting research results online for those who would not otherwise have a way to access them.</p>

    <p>If open access were the default for scholarly communication, cases like Diego's would become obsolete.</p>

    <p>Academic research would be free to access and available under an open license that would legally enable the kind of sharing that is so crucial for enabling scientific progress.
    When research is shared freely and openly we all benefit. Sign below to express your support for open access as the default for scientific and scholarly publishing, so researchers like Diego don't risk severe penalties for helping colleagues access the research they need.</p>
